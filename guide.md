<section data-subcategory="Integrations">

Use of Sigstore is sometimes transparent to users as its signing and verification functionality is seamlessly integrated with version control or build software. This section highlights open source and closed source tools, platforms and applications that integrate Sigstore functionality such that users of those tools may benefit from software signing and verification.
